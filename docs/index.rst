Python with RabbitMQâ€”simplified so you won't have to.

Features
--------
Stop worrying about boilerplating and implementing retry logic on your queues. PyRMQ already
does it for you.

- Use out-of-the-box and thread-safe `Consumer` and `Publisher` classes created from `pika`_ for your projects and tests.
- Built-in retry-backoff logic for connecting, consuming, and publishing.
- Works with Python 3.
- Production ready.

Quickstart
----------
Just instantiate the feature you want with their respective settings.
PyRMQ already works out of the box with RabbitMQ's `default initialization settings`_.

.. code-block:: python

    from pyrmq import Publisher
    publisher = Publisher(
        exchange_name="exchange_name",
        queue_name="queue_name",
        routing_key="routing_key",
    )
    publisher.publish({"pyrmq": "My first message"})
